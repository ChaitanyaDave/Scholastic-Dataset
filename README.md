# Scholastic-Dataset

This was part of my group project during 2nd semester in my MSc Business Analytics at UCD.

We analysed dataset comprising of 2M rows and 22 columns containing missing entries, incorrect datatype and duplicate data computing to 23% of the data 
which was cleaned by writing SQL queries and R scripts to make it more useable. 

After that we created interactive and insightful dashboards to identify data trends using Microsoft Power BI.

•	Identified that sales drop sharply past a k-4 Lexile difficulty level; this is highlighted by the fact that the best-selling category is Reluctant Reader, accounting for 28% of all sale.
•	Recommended that Scholastic would be best served by selling books in $5-$7 price range.

This was our first time using Power BI software, it was a great experience and really loved the product.

NOTE: .pbix file is too large to upload over here, hence I have uploaded a video, pdf version of the reports and supporting SQL/R queries which were used during the project.
